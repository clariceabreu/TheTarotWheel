# TheTarotWheel

This is a mobile application developed by Clarice Abreu.

The app isn't yet finished, but its goal is to create a game using Tarot cards.
The player will spin a wheel contaning the Tarot cards and the app will show some information of the card that was withdrawn.

The app is being developed on Xamrin in Visual Studio and when it is finished it will be available on App Store and Play Store.
